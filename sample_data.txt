The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is an advanced approach to natural language processing that combines information retrieval with text generation. Unlike traditional language models, RAG can dynamically retrieve relevant documents to enhance its responses.

For example, when a user asks about a historical event, a RAG-based system first searches a knowledge base for relevant documents and then generates a response based on the retrieved information. This approach improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge.

RAG systems typically use a vector database for efficient semantic search. The user query is converted into an embedding, which is then compared against stored document embeddings to find the most relevant pieces of text.

A key advantage of RAG is its ability to incorporate real-time updates. Since the model retrieves information dynamically, it can provide more up-to-date answers without requiring frequent retraining.

Developers often use frameworks like LangChain and vector stores like Faiss or Chroma to build RAG pipelines. These tools streamline the process of chunking text, embedding storage, and retrieval.

In summary, RAG improves chatbot capabilities by enhancing knowledge recall, making AI-generated responses more accurate and contextually relevant.
